\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

\subsection{Conclusion}
Duckieboat is a low-cost, easy-assemble vehicle, it could widely implement to engineering education, maritime research and rescue missions.

\subsection{Future Work}
We plan to combine Duckieboat with the underwater unmanned maritime vehicle, looking forward to explore underwater environments, which is also unfamiliar to human.

We are also looking forward to upgrade our hardware to make it safer, durable and more user friendly.
