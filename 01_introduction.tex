\section{Introduction}

Duckieboat is an Unmanned maritime vehicle. Due to the cost of building an unmanned maritime vehicle is very expensive and time consuming. We decide to design a low-cost, high-durability, modular-design and easy-assemble boat which can implement in our research. It is also capable of transform into a variety of water applications, such as boat following, material supply, garbage collection and difficult environment marine exploration. We hope our Duckieboat will enhance the safety of sea in the future and can make the supply of water sports enthusiasts more convenient. Duckieboat also can implement in the teaching field, make students learn more about the related principles of autonomous boat.
